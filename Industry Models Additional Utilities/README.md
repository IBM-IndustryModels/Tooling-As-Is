From time to time, the IBM Industry Models team  make available 'Industry Models - Additional Utilities'. 
If this folder does not contain any repository installers (.zip files) then there are no current additional utilties available. 

When using both the 'Industry Models Utilities' and 'Industry Models - Additional Utilities' -- it is imperative that compatible builds
are only installed together. This is because 'Industry Models - Additional Utilities' has a hard dependency on being installed after
a compatible 'Industry Models Utilities'. e.g. The version within of installation repoistories;
	e.g. 4100.I20170330-0143 ... identifies compatible installation pairs.

Compatible versions of 'Industry Models Utilities' are available to download on;
https://github.com/IBM-IndustryModels/Tooling-Repo/tree/master/Industry-Models-Utilities

There is no direct support offered for these components.
